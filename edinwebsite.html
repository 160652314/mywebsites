<h1> Edinburgh History </h1> 
 
<p> Edinburgh has been the capital of Scotland since 1437, when it replaced Scone. The Scottish Parliament resides in Edinburgh. However, in the past, Edinburgh Castle was often under English control. Before the 10th Century, Edinburgh was under the control of the Anglo-Saxons and Danelaw. </p>
